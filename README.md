# Hands on Julia

Material for a 2-day workshop on Julia, first given at the 
Université de Paris-Sud on June 16th and 17th, 2015.

The material consists of directed exercises, aimed to 
provide a "hands-on" way of learning Julia by getting the
user to try out ideas semi-autonomously, as opposed to 
standard tutorials, which tend to give all the answers 
immediately.

I (David Sanders) was the on-site instructor for both days,
helping sort out installation problems, asking questions,
and discussing various points at the front of the class.
